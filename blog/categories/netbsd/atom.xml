    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To be frank I wasn&rsquo;t doing much for almost an year, got lazy as one can ever be. Today was the day to break it. Got a little push do something and I got down to do it. I was looking at BSD development for a long time, and thought this is the best time to get involved. I am a total noob at BSD, I never really used one. So it was challenging when I started to install NetBSD into an old Comapq nx6120 that was lying around. I know anyone could get to the root shell easily, with help from brilliant click and go installers, configuring and customizing was the real problem.</p>

<p>Its 0300 now, and I got my laptop running NetBSD 6.0, and connected to wireless (easier than I thought &ndash; thanks to legacy hardware.)</p>

<p><strong>Configuring Intel PRO/Wireless </strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong>Unlike linux, BSD can include all the microcode (firmware) in the distribution itself, due the flexibility of licensing system. Reading up <em>iwi(4)</em> reveals youve to accept the EULA by setting the sysctl variable hw.iwi.accept_eula to 1</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>sysctl -w hw.iwi.accept_eula=1</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The university wireless is open, so I didnt had to mess too much.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>ifconfig ssid &ldquo;SSID&rdquo; iwi0 dhclient iwi0</h1>

<p>```</p>
