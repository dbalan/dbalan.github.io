Love makes you see the world a lot different than you used to. Life suddenly gets filled with warm glowing colors. Opens up the each and every long sealed corridors of you heart and makes them beat in rhythm, orchestrating a symphony of life. The amount of happiness your life gets filled with might be the real definition of infinity

Being in love is a privilege, Gifted by a heart indeed is the greatest ever. Even parting hearts cant take away your happiness. We loose and keep some fragments and memories weaved in golden threads. For me, they will be sufficient to push the emptiness of existence out for a life time. More than enough to remain in love
