I use octopress with github hosting my pages.
Everytime I sit down to write, I have to look up commands in my bash history and read documentation. Its very distracting when you just want to write.

Maybe its my workflow thats wrong, I should replace all this with a set of small shell scripts :-P, maybe octopress 3.0 (insert another tool) will solve this.

But at this point I dont even remember which branch in my repo has what, and I should switch to a firendlier paltform (ghost or posthaven) or do a massive cleanup ASAP.

_EDIT: I finally managed to do that clean up_
