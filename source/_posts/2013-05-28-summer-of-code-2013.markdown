Google published summer of code results yesterday. I am happy that I was selected. My project is titled __Better GDB support for RTEMS__, it is mentored by _Ms. Jennifer Averett_ from RTEMS. You can find [my proposal here](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/dhananjay/35002).
