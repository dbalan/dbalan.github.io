Finally my exams are over and I am set free to do watever I like. Now I can start working on my GSoC. People say work is what defines a person, his contributions, however small, is what makes his life worthy of living. I am looking forward to a joyful vacation doing what I like the most, some serious hacking and doing my part of work. A million thanks to the creators of the Summer of code program, and also to my mentor, Steffan. You guys rock.
