I loved posterous. I don't know how I missed it but till the final day I had no clue they were shutting down. It was an hour of panic. I had every itch not to go back to wordpress. It was bloated and just not my thing, and Jekyll was way to much work!

Then I found Octopress - just the right thing, simply perfect. And it was love at first sight. :)
