In my openion [ACT](http://portal.acttv.in) is the best ISP in [Bangalore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore), I found this network to be much better than any other provider in terms of reliability and the bandwidth, they seem very hacker friendly too, logging in as straightforward as a simple HTTP POST. 

I have this script running in my router so that I never have to bother logging in.
