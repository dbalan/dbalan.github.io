By free I never meant something like a holiday you get in ages which
exactly pumps you up. By "free" I meant day you dont have a clue to do
anything. You suddenly find yourself nothing interesting to do. Gets you
bored to the bones. A couple of people can cheer me up these times but unfortunately none
are around.

I hate it, because it breaks the barriers I've put in mind to the past.
On a blink, mind gets filled with everything that has happened in the
twenty years thats me, and most of them are not good things.

Writing never been my favorite, but its the only way left. So I am
falling back to my little diary. Nobodys' been a good listener.
