This is just another day I thanked web 2.0, this time the story goes like this.

 I needed to prepare a LaTeX document on the go, had no laptop with me and I couldnt find one with LaTeX installed, and installing LaTeX with current internet speeds, was the unthinkable.

 I tried to settle with a word processor, but the idea hit me that I should search web, a simple search took me to [http://duckduckgo.com/?q=online+latex+editors](http://duckduckgo.com/?q=online+latex+editors)

 I selected two links from the top,
[MonkeyTex](http://monkeytex.bradcater.webfactional.com/) has a really simple no frills yet beautiful interface, where [ScribeTex](https://www.scribtex.com/) offer a feature filled one. They also offer paid plans, other than a free plan which restricts you in number of projects and collaborators.
